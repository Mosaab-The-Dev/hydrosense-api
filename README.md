## AI Features

### Water Quality Analysis

The API uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to analyze water quality data and provide:

- **Summary**: Clear explanation of what the measurements mean
- **Solutions**: Specific recommendations if water quality issues are detected

### Similar Experiment Detection

When updating an experiment with sensor data, the API:

1. Compares current readings with historical data from `experimentsBank`
2. Identifies the most similar experiment based on pH, temperature, and turbidity
3. Converts coordinates to country names for geographic context
4. Provides a natural language explanation of the similarity

## Environment Variables

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/hydrosense"

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
